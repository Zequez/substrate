Focus System
There is a Focusable Matrix
The Focusable Matrix has Distinct Dimensional Levels (DDL)
The Focusable Matrix has an Edge

You transverse the Focusable Matrix using WASD
You navigate between DDL by using E and Q
You are always Focused At a Node Cluster
An individual Node is seen as a single-node Node Cluster
You can expand what you are Focused At to create an Expanded View
An Expanded View can be split infinitely
An Expanded View splits the screen by being aware of the relative Node Sizes of the Node Cluster and Personal Preference
